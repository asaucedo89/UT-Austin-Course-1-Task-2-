# UT Austin Course 1, Task 2
Predicting Profitability with RapidMiner

Team,

The sales team is considering adding some new products to Blackwell's product mix. They have shortlisted 17 that fit Blackwell’s business strategy, but now they need help narrowing the list down to five. I would like to help the sales team by predicting the profitability of each of the potential new products.

I would like you to investigate this question by performing a detailed analysis using regression methods in RapidMiner. Specifically, I would like you to perform a regression analysis to predict the sales volume of each of the potential new products from which profitability can be estimated. In this analysis, our assumption is that certain attributes are associated with highly successful (current) products and, therefore, any potential new products that also have these attributes will be similarly successful, regardless of if a potential new product is similar to an existing product or not. 

You will use two new methods for your regression analysis — k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—and you will also explore a new method called Boosting to improve the performance of decision trees. You will need to iteratively adjust the parameters of each algorithm to get the best model. You will then compare the error metrics for your optimized models to assess which one works best. After you have trained your models and determined which one is more accurate, you will apply the model to all of the potential products to predict their sales volumes. After predicting each potential new product’s sales volume, you can predict the monthly profits by multiplying the predicted sales volume by the product’s price and its profit margin.

Please rank all products in order of highest to lowest profit. I have already set up the data for you in the attached .zip file, which contains the three CSV files you will need.

I am looking forward to reviewing your analysis. This will be a big help to the sales team.

Thank you,

Danielle
